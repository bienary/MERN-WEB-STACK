## 🎯**DevOps/Cloud Engineering > MERN WEB STACK**
📌 **MERN Web Stack** is a powerful JavaScript-based framework for building full-stack web applications. It seamlessly connects the database, backend, and frontend, allowing developers to create dynamic, scalable, and high-performance applications using a single programming language from start to finish.

> M — `MongoDB` → A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.

> E — `Express.js` → A sever side Web Application framework for Node.js.

> R — `React.js` → A frontend framework developed by facebook. It is based on `JavaScript`, used to build User Interface (UI) components.

> N — `Node.js` → A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.
