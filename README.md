## üéØ**DevOps/Cloud Engineering > MERN WEB STACK**
üìå **MERN Web Stack** is a powerful JavaScript-based framework for building full-stack web applications. It seamlessly connects the database, backend, and frontend, allowing developers to create dynamic, scalable, and high-performance applications using a single programming language from start to finish.

**üß∞MERN Web Stack consists of following components:**

> M ‚Äî `MongoDB` ‚Üí A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.

> E ‚Äî `Express.js` ‚Üí A sever side Web Application framework for Node.js.

> R ‚Äî `React.js` ‚Üí A frontend framework developed by facebook. It is based on `JavaScript`, used to build User Interface (UI) components.

> N ‚Äî `Node.js` ‚Üí A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

## **STEP 0 ~ PREPARING PREREQUISITES**
- To complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.
- Sign in to AWS free tier account and create a new EC2 Instance of t3.micro family with Ubuntu Server 24.04.
- After creating your EC2 Instances, you can add  `Tag Name` to it with a value that corresponds to a current project you are working on.

---
- You can also set up your `Mobaxterm` to connect to EC2 Instances.

### **Install Node.js on the server**

`NPM` is a package manager for Node like apt for Ubuntu, it is used to install Node modules & packages and to manage dependency conflicts.
- Run the command below to install both `nodejs` and `npm.`

```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

- Verify the node installation with the command below.

```
node -v
```

- Verify the node installation with the command below.

```
npm -v
```

### **Application Code Setup**

- Create a new directory for your `To-DO` project:

```
mkdir Todo
```

Run the command below to verify that the `Todo` directory is created with `ls` command.

```
ls
```

üìù To see more useful information about files and directories, use the following combination of keys `ls -lih`. You can learn more about different useful keys for `ls` command with `ls --help`.

- Change your curruent directory to the newly created one:

```
cd Todo
```
